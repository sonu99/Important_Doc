cc -E test.c -o test.i
cc -S test.i -o test.s
cc -c test.s -o test.o

=> Difference between “int main()” and “int main(void)” in C/C++?

// Program 1 (Compiles and runs fine in C, but not in C++)
void fun() {  } 
int main(void)
{
    fun(10, "GfG", "GQ");
    return 0;
}
Run on IDE
The above program compiles and runs fine (See this), but the following program fails in compilation (see this)

// Program 2 (Fails in compilation in both C and C++)
void fun(void) {  }
int main(void)
{
    fun(10, "GfG", "GQ");
    return 0;
}

=> Is it fine to write “void main()” or “main()” in C/C++?

Que on Const and volatile qulifier

Ans: Global variables modified by an interrupt service routine outside the scope: For example,
a global variable can represent a data port (usually global pointer referred as memory mapped IO) which will be updated dynamically. 
The code reading data port must be declared as volatile in order to fetch latest data available at the port.
Failing to declare variable as volatile, the compiler will optimize the code in such a way that 
it will read the port only once and keeps using the same value in a temporary register to speed up the program (speed optimization).
In general, an ISR used to update these data port when there is an interrupt due to availability of new data
